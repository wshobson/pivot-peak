# Pivot Peak

Simple trendline detection app. You give it a symbol and the number of days to look back, and it will return the trendlines for the given symbol.

Based on the excellent work of [pytrendline](https://github.com/ednunezg/pytrendline).

You can currently view this app in the Streamlit Cloud at [https://pivot-peak.streamlit.app/](https://pivot-peak.streamlit.app/).
